# Parallel-Robotic-Platform-for-Vehicle-Motion-Simulation
The Simulink file includes a model of three legged parallel platform robot used for vehicle motion simulation. 

Open the Tripod_Model and run it. Before running the Simulink model make sure that the working folder of the MATLAB is set to the model folder. You can change the parameters in Tripod_Model_configuration.m file.
